To compile this program, you need to have both the Java SDK and JavaFX 1.3 SDK. 

I use Netbeans 6.9.1 to write it, so you should be able to load the project in 
Netbeans and compile it that way.

I'm not sure how exactly to compile it with the command prompt, but if you want 
to try, the Main Class is ifcSoft.MainApp, which is a JavaFX file.
